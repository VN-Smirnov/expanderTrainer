A while ago, while working on my hobby in the garage, I injured my finger joint with an angle grinder. To recover quickly, I needed to use a hand gripper regularly. For this, I created a simple Qt program.

**Workout routine**:

- 6 sets of 1 minute each.

- 5 rest periods between sets.

- Each set alternates between 7 seconds of hand compression and 3 seconds of rest.

Switching between compression and rest is signaled by audio alerts and a color-coded timer indicator.

The build system is currently static (qmake). The program requires DirectX 12 to run. This is still an intermediate version.

## Take care of yourselves and your health!
